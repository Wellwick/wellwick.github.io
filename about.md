My real name is Michael Boyle, but I've been going by the moniker of Wellwick 
for over a decade now. The dog over there isn't actually me (believe it or not), 
but I thought I could spare you from my face and show you my dog at the same 
time. Her name is Ruby and she is lovely.

I'm a Software Engineer currently at Studio Gobo making games. I graduated 
from Warwick back in 2018 with a MEng Computer Science degree. I'm a moderator 
on the [Parahumans Discord](https://discord.gg/TYsRHpG) where I help develop the 
primary bot. I run a regular Dungeons and Dragons game for a few friends and do
my best to dabble in writing, though I haven't published much at all.

I spend most of my days making games in Unreal and loving every minute of it.
It's been a dream since I was young to make games, so don't give up on those
ambitions, kids.

### Contact me

You can reach me at my email 
[mbbexley@hotmail.co.uk](mailto:mbbexley@hotmail.co.uk), however you're more 
likely to get a hold of me urgently by joining the Discord mentioned above and 
PMing Wellwick. I'll usually be over on the right sidebar, twiddling my thumbs.
