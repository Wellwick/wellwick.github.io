I'm a Software Developer working at Autodesk in the UK. I'm a moderator on the [Parahumans Discord](https://discord.gg/TYsRHpG) where I help develop the primary bot and run a campaign of Weaverdice (a Dungeons and Dragons style game but with superheroes). I also do my best to dabble in writing, though I haven't published much at all.
