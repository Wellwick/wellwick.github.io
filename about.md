My real name is Michael Boyle, but I've been going by the moniker of Wellwick 
for over a decade now. The dog over there isn't actually me (believe it or not), 
but I thought I could spare you from my face and show you my dog at the same 
time. Her name is Ruby and she is lovely.

I'm a Software Developer currently working at Autodesk in the UK. I graduated 
from Warwick back in 2018 with a MEng Computer Science degree. I'm a moderator 
on the [Parahumans Discord](https://discord.gg/TYsRHpG) where I help develop the 
primary bot and run a campaign of Weaverdice (a Dungeons and Dragons style game 
but with superheroes). I also do my best to dabble in writing, though I haven't 
published much at all.

One day I'd love to do some game developement or something in that vein, but 
there's a lot of work between here and there. Sometimes I work on a graphics 
tablet I own in an attempt to get better at drawing, but it's by far my weakest 
creative skill. Still all things take practice!

### Contact me

You can reach me at my email 
[mbbexley@hotmail.co.uk](mailto:mbbexley@hotmail.co.uk), however you're more 
likely to get a hold of me urgently by joining the Discord mentioned above and 
PMing Wellwick. I'll usually be over on the right sidebar, twiddling my thumbs.
