Well, it's been a while. Over two years have passed since I last wrote something
on this blog, and the world has changed a fair bit. I've changed jobs, now
working at [Studio Gobo](https://www.studiogobo.com/) making video games.
It really wasn't as difficult to get into the games industry as I was imagining.
It taught me a valuable lesson about being honest with people - if you show
genuine passion for something, that makes up for lack of experience in a lot of
cases.

I'm surrounded by very clever and talented people, and I certainly feel like I
need to catch up. I'm juggling some extra work on another game project outside
of Gobo, which can be hectic but I'm certainly learning a lot.

Unreal is the coolest engine ever, I can't believe it took me so long to switch
over from Unity. Unity has plenty to help developers, but Epic clearly invests
a lot in making sure developers are well looked after. As with everything, there
are years of out-of-date documentation to sift through, or features that do the
same thing as something else, but there are plenty of people around to help out.
The main issue I run into nowadays is taking in so much information and
underlying functionality that my brain shuts down for a while as I try to
process everything.

My [about page]({{ site.baseurl }}/about) used to say "One day I'd love to do
some game developement or something in that vein, but there's a lot of work
between here and there." It's very strange changing that, but I did write it 
three whole years ago, so I suppose I wasn't wrong when I said there would be a
lot of work to do.

If you're reading further back, you probably see the Pitchford posts, and can
guess that that never finished. Unfinished projects always sit at the back of
my head, bugging me, like
[a story](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13697664/1/Bartowski-Unleashed) I started
writing a couple of years ago which has a chapter 4 ready to publish, but never
released. I'm much better about accepting how limited my time really is compared
to a few years ago, but I do find myself wishing for more time in the day all
the time.

I'd love to make my own game, and I have an idea percolating in my head about a
smaller (but still open-world) game set in the same area as my current Dungeons
and Dragons campaign. The problem I've noticed about taking on many roles in a
project is that you can end up doing lots of things badly, rather than a single
thing well. Trying to keep the whole thing in your head is really hard to do,
even if it does keep the excitement up.

Any project, even a game that's an hour long, will take a long time to complete.
Even then, there might be little to no reception of it, which would just be
depressing. I think a lot about the value of my time, and that if I was to spend
one hundred hours on something, as long as a hundred people got an hour of
enjoyment or use out of it, then it is still valuable. Honestly, though, for a
lot of the things I make and put out into the world, I have a relatively
positive reception from - maybe not the game jam stuff, but I know how to get my
writing in front of audiences eyes.

I think, if I'm going to make my own (small) game, I'll have to focus on my
writing strength and give players something to engage with there. Getting bogged
down in the technical aspects is likely to mean I circle myself for a while and
burn out before I get to a release point. I also need to remind myself it is
better to make something small and put it out there than make something too
ambitious that never sees the light of day. It's the same thing with code, or
subsequent series of TV shows after the first - building on a good (even if
basic) foundation is a safer approach.
