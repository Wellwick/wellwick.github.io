I wasn't quite happy with everything that I had done. My username at the top is now just Wellwick, the short bio is shorter, but I've expanded the main bio to cover things in more detail.

There are more details I am testing, like whether newlines actually allow you to continue on the same line in the HTML.
It's written in markup, so I'm expecting it to, but worth checking so that I can start formatting my posts for readability.

I'm also not sure how the system orders the posts. Is the reason for specifying the post in the style year-month-day because it only expects a single post a day? Or is the system smarter than that and it figures out when the file was first created, using that to order the posts. We shall see.

I do think that when you've made a few hundred blog posts, it would be pretty untenable to just add another file to the folder. Also, I'm not aware of any way to tag posts, but I haven't really gone looking yet either. Perhaps I'll find something.

I've added a photo of my dog as the avatar! She is very pretty and I love her very much. I'm considering that it might be amusing to have the avatar randomly change, and I could store a bunch of images of Ruby on the server for it to cycle through, though I'd have to see just how much Jekyll is capable of.

One thing I learned today that I didn't know before: VS Code has in built functionality to view images (at least PNGs and JPGs). Not a revolutionary thing, but it's nice to see little features like that benefit developers.
