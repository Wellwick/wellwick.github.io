I've started reading Killing Floor by Lee Child. The author might sound 
familiar, his name pretty much ubiqutious with the protagonist Jack Reacher, 
which Killing Floor kicks off the series for.

I've not finished the story (hell, I'm not even halfway through), but I noticed
something about it quite early on and it got me thinking.

The following lines appear on page 24.

```'My name is Jack Reacher,' I said. 'No middle name. No address.'
He wrote it down. Not much to write. I told him my date of birth.```

The text itself starts on page 11, but it's 13 pages later that you hear the 
main character's name for the first time. You're in his head for the entire 
book, but you don't really notice that you are missing this 'critical' detail.

It got me thinking about what's necessary to reveal to the reader and how you 
can pace those information bits. Ignoring exposition for a while means you get 
to focus on what's happening rather than filling out backstory. I know a lot 
of writers who are so exciting to share with the audience all of the 
worldbuilding they've gone that they forget they are meant to be telling a 
story.

Reacher is accused of murder, but it's a few dozen pages before he himself 
confirms in his head that he is innocent. Part of that will be stylistic 
choice, but it works well because it leaves the question the audience is 
asking as "Did Reacher kill them?" The moment you answer that question either 
way, you have questions of motive, how he did it (though that is answered 
during the questioning), and since the answer is no, who really did the 
killing?

Managing how many questions your readers have at any one point is important. 
Too many questions and the reader is liable to get confused or overwhelmed, 
too few and they may feel like there isn't anything driving the story forward 
or that there simply isn't any mystery (which might require some breakneck 
pacing to keep their attention).
