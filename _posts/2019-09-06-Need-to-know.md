I've started reading Killing Floor by Lee Child. The author might sound 
familiar, his name pretty much ubiqutious with the protagonist Jack Reacher, 
which Killing Floor kicks off the series for.

I've not finished the story (hell, I'm not even halfway through), but I noticed
something about it quite early on and it got me thinking.

The following lines appear on page 24.

```'My name is Jack Reacher,' I said. 'No middle name. No address.'
He wrote it down. Not much to write. I told him my date of birth.```

The text itself starts on page 11, but it's 13 pages later that you hear the 
main character's name for the first time. You're in his head for the entire 
book, but you don't really notice that you are missing this 'critical' detail.
