This is forked work from the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). My plan is to use it for a bit of a personal blog, potentially expanding some functionality into things that interest me.

For now, you can find some info on me on the [About page]({{ site.baseurl }}/about).
